# Othello

Implementation of game Othello. Othello is a classical games that can be solved by artificial intelligent methods. It belong to search techniques in artificial intelligence. Many searching algorithms have been raised to solve this problem. In this project, some searching algorithms are implemented, including local maximization, minimax, and Alpha-beta prunning. Finally, experiment results are given to show characteristics of each searching algorithm.
